# Battlecode 2024
## don't eat my nonorientable shapes (strequals, ender)

This is our repository containing the source code for our Battlecode 2024 bot. Our final bot is in `src/ineedtodomypdehw`. Thanks to XSquare (https://github.com/IvanGeffner/BC22), from whom much of our micro and bug code is derived, Teh Devs for yet another fun battlecode season, and to wololo and Super Cow Powers for various strategy/algorithm ideas.
